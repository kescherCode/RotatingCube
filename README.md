# RotatingCube
A small C# console application to display a cube and rotate it, manually or automatically.

Controls:

  - W and S rotate the cube up or down in the x-axis.
  - A and D rotate the cube up or down in the y-axis.
  - J and K rotate the cube up or down in the z-axis.
  - Hold ALT before holding any above keys and the cube will rotate faster.
  - Same goes for SHIFT, except it's going to rotate slower.
  - Press M to toggle between manual (default) and automatic modes. Also note that you can't control the cube in this mode, not even with modifiers like SHIFT and ALT.
  - Press ESC to exit the program at any time.

Nothing too special. Feel free to tell your friends it was yours or sell it (lol), it's public domain!
